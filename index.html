        <h2> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/"> Mercury</a></h2>
        <img src="mercury.jpeg">
        <p>
            <strong>mercury</strong> is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. Its orbit
            around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets. It is named after the Roman
            god Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce, messenger of the gods, and mediator between gods and mortals,
            corresponding to the Greek god Hermes (Ἑρμῆς). Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an
            inferior planet, and its apparent distance from the Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28°. This
            proximity to the Sun means the planet can only be seen near the western horizon after sunset or the eastern
            horizon before sunrise, usually in twilight. At this time, it may appear as a bright star-like object, but
            is more difficult to observe than Venus. From Earth, the planet telescopically displays the complete range
            of phases, similar to Venus and the Moon, which recurs over its synodic period of approximately 116 days.
            The synodic proximity of Mercury to Earth makes Mercury most of the time Earth's closest planet, despite
            Venus at times approaching Earth closer than any other planet can.[17][18]

            Mercury rotates in a way that is unique in the Solar System. It is tidally locked with the Sun in a 3:2
            spin–orbit resonance,[19] meaning that relative to the fixed stars, it rotates on its axis exactly three
            times for every two revolutions it makes around the Sun.[a][20] As seen from the Sun, in a frame of
            reference that rotates with the orbital motion, it appears to rotate only once every two Mercurian years. An
            observer on Mercury would therefore see only one day every two Mercurian years.

        <h2> <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/venus/overview/"> Venus</a></h2>
        <img src="venus.jpeg">
        <p>
            <strong>Venus</strong> is the second planet from the Sun. It is sometimes called Earth's "sister" or "twin"
            planet as it is almost as large and has a similar composition. As an interior planet to Earth, Venus (like
            Mercury) appears in Earth's sky never far from the Sun, either as morning star or evening star. Aside from
            the Sun and Moon, Venus is the brightest natural object in Earth's sky, capable of casting visible shadows
            on Earth at dark conditions and being visible to the naked eye in broad daylight.[18][19]

            Venus is the second largest terrestrial object of the Solar System, with a surface gravity minimally lower
            than on Earth, but having only an induced magnetosphere. The carbon dioxide atmosphere of Venus is the
            densest of the four terrestrial planets. The atmospheric pressure at the planet's surface is about 92 times
            the sea level pressure of Earth, or roughly the pressure at 900 m (3,000 ft) underwater on Earth. Even
            though Mercury is closer to the Sun, Venus has the hottest surface of any planet in the Solar System, with a
            mean temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F). Venus is shrouded by an opaque layer of highly reflective clouds
            of sulfuric acid, preventing its surface from being seen from Earth in light. It may have had water oceans
            in the past,[20][21] but after these evaporated the temperature rose under a runaway greenhouse effect.[22]
            The water has probably photodissociated, and the free hydrogen has been swept into interplanetary space by
            the solar wind because of the lack of an internally induced magnetic field.[23] At roughly 50 km above the
            surface atmospheric conditions reach Earth-like temperatures and levels of pressure. The possibility of life
            on Venus has long been a topic of speculation but convincing evidence has yet to be found.

        <h3> <a href="https://earth.google.com/"> Earth</a></h3>
        <img src="earth.jpeg" />
        <p>
            <strong>Earth</strong> is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor
            life. While large volumes of water can be found throughout the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid
            surface water. About 71% of Earth's surface is made up of the ocean, dwarfing Earth's polar ice, lakes, and
            rivers. The remaining 29% of Earth's surface is land, consisting of continents and islands. Earth's surface
            layer is formed of several slowly moving tectonic plates, interacting to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes,
            and earthquakes. Earth's liquid outer core generates the magnetic field that shapes Earth's magnetosphere,
            deflecting destructive solar winds.

            Earth's atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere like carbon
            dioxide (CO2) trap a part of the energy from the Sun close to the surface. Water vapor is widely present in
            the atmosphere and forms clouds that cover most of the planet. More solar energy is received by tropical
            regions than polar regions and is redistributed by atmospheric and ocean circulation. A region's climate is
            governed by latitude, but also by elevation and proximity to moderating oceans. In most areas severe
            weather, such as tropical cyclones, thunderstorms, and heatwaves, occurs and greatly impacts life.

            Earth is an ellipsoid with a circumference of about 40,000 km. It is the densest planet in the Solar System.
            Of the four rocky planets, it is the largest and most massive. Earth is about eight light minutes away from
            the Sun and orbits it, taking a year (about 365.25 days) to complete one revolution. Earth rotates around
            its own axis in slightly less than a day (in about 23 hours and 56 minutes). Earth's axis of rotation is
            tilted with respect to the perpendicular to its orbital plane around the Sun, producing seasons. Earth is
            orbited by one permanent natural satellite, the Moon, which orbits Earth at 380,000 km (1.3 light seconds)
            and is roughly a quarter as wide as Earth. The Moon always faces the Earth with the same side through tidal
            locking and causes tides, stabilizes Earth's axis, and gradually slows its rotation.

        <h3> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars"> Mars</a></h3>
        <img src="mars.2.jpeg"/>
        <p>
            <strong>Mars</strong> is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System,
            being larger than only Mercury. In the English language, Mars is named for the Roman god of war. Mars is a
            terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere (less than 1% that of Earth's), and has a crust primarily composed
            of elements similar to Earth's crust, as well as a core made of iron and nickel. Mars has surface features
            such as impact craters, valleys, dunes, and polar ice caps. It has two small and irregularly shaped moons:
            Phobos and Deimos.

            Some of the most notable surface features on Mars include Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and highest
            known mountain on any planet in the Solar System, and Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the
            Solar System. The Borealis basin in the Northern Hemisphere covers approximately 40% of the planet and may
            be a large impact feature.[20] Days and seasons on Mars are comparable to those of Earth, as the planets
            have a similar rotation period and tilt of the rotational axis relative to the ecliptic plane. Liquid water
            on the surface of Mars cannot exist due to low atmospheric pressure, which is less than 1% of the
            atmospheric pressure on Earth.[21][22] Both of Mars's polar ice caps appear to be made largely of
            water.[23][24] In the distant past, Mars was likely wetter, and thus possibly more suited for life. However,
            it is unknown whether life has ever existed on Mars.

            Mars has been explored by several uncrewed spacecraft, beginning with Mariner 4 in 1965. NASA's Viking 1
            lander transmitted in 1976 the first images from the Martian surface. Two countries have successfully
            deployed rovers on Mars, the United States first doing so with Sojourner in 1997 and China with Zhurong in
            2021.[25] There are also planned future missions to Mars, such as a Mars sample-return mission set to happen
            in 2026, and the Rosalind Franklin rover mission, which was intended to launch in 2018 but was delayed to
            2024 at the earliest, with a more likely launch date at 2028.

        <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter">Jupiter</a></h3>
        <img src="jupiter.jpeg" />
        <p><strong>Jupiter</strong> is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas
            giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined,
            but slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter is the third brightest natural object in
            the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus, and it has been observed since prehistoric times. It was
            named after the Roman god Jupiter, the king of the gods.

            Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen, but helium constitutes one-quarter of its mass and one-tenth of
            its volume. It probably has a rocky core of heavier elements, but, like the other giant planets in the Solar
            System, it lacks a well-defined solid surface. The ongoing contraction of Jupiter's interior generates more
            heat than it receives from the Sun. Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is an oblate spheroid:
            it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator. The outer atmosphere is divided into a series of
            latitudinal bands, with turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent result of this
            is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm which has been observed since at least 1831.

            Jupiter is surrounded by a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere. Jupiter's magnetic tail
            is nearly 800 million km (5.3 AU; 500 million mi) long, covering nearly the entire distance to Saturn's
            orbit. Jupiter has 80 known moons and possibly many more, including the four large moons discovered by
            Galileo Galilei in 1610: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Io and Europa are about the size of Earth's
            Moon; Callisto is almost the size of the planet Mercury, and Ganymede is larger.

        <h3><a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/saturn/overview/">Saturn</a></h3>
        <img src="saturn.jpeg" />
        <p><strong>Saturn</strong> is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after
            Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine and a half times that of Earth.[23][24] It
            has only one-eighth the average density of Earth; however, with its larger volume, Saturn is over 95 times
            more massive.[25][26][27]

            Saturn's interior is most likely composed of a core of iron–nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen compounds).
            Its core is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and
            liquid helium, and finally, a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in
            its upper atmosphere. An electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to
            Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's, but which has a magnetic moment 580 times
            that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth of
            Jupiter's.[28] The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features
            can appear. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800 km/h (1,100 mph; 500 m/s), higher than on Jupiter but not
            as high as on Neptune.[29]

            The planet's most notable feature is its prominent ring system, which is composed mainly of ice particles,
            with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. At least 83 moons[30] are known to orbit Saturn, of which 53
            are officially named; this does not include the hundreds of moonlets in its rings. Titan, Saturn's largest
            moon and the second largest in the Solar System, is larger than the planet Mercury, although less massive,
            and is the only moon in the Solar System to have a substantial atmosphere.[31]

        <h4><a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/uranus/overview/">Uranus</a></h4>
        <img src="uranus.jpeg">
        <p><strong>Uranus</strong> is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its name is a reference to the Greek god of the
            sky, Uranus (Caelus), who, according to Greek mythology, was the great-grandfather of Ares (Mars),
            grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter) and father of Cronus (Saturn). It has the third-largest planetary radius and
            fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both
            have bulk chemical compositions which differ from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. For this
            reason, scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them from the other
            giant planets.

            As with gas giants, ice giants also lack a well defined "solid surface." Uranus's atmosphere is similar to
            Jupiter's and Saturn's in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium, but it contains more "ices" such
            as water, ammonia, and methane, along with traces of other hydrocarbons.[17] It has the coldest planetary
            atmosphere in the Solar System, with a minimum temperature of 49 K (−224 °C; −371 °F), and has a complex,
            layered cloud structure with water thought to make up the lowest clouds and methane the uppermost layer of
            clouds.[17] The interior of Uranus is mainly composed of ices and rock.[16]

            Like the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, a magnetosphere, and numerous moons. The Uranian
            system has a unique configuration because its axis of rotation is tilted sideways, nearly into the plane of
            its solar orbit. Its north and south poles, therefore, lie where most other planets have their equators.[21]
            In 1986, images from Voyager 2 showed Uranus as an almost featureless planet in visible light, without the
            cloud bands or storms associated with the other giant planets.[21] Voyager 2 remains the only spacecraft to
            visit the planet.[22] Observations from Earth have shown seasonal change and increased weather activity as
            Uranus approached its equinox in 2007. Wind speeds can reach 250 metres per second (900 km/h; 560 mph).[23]

        <h4><a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/neptune/overview/">Neptune</a></h4>
        <img src="neptune.jpeg">
        <p><strong>Neptune</strong> is the eighth planet from the Sun and the farthest known solar planet. In the Solar
            System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant
            planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth, and slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is
            denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of
            its atmosphere. It is referred to as one of the solar system's two ice giant planets (the other one being
            Uranus). Being composed primarily of gases and liquids, it has no well-defined "solid surface". The planet
            orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 AU (4.5 billion km; 2.8 billion mi). It
            is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol ♆, representing Neptune's
            trident.[d]

            Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by mathematical
            prediction rather than by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis
            Bouvard to hypothesise that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. After
            Bouvard's death, the position of Neptune was predicted from his observations, independently, by John Couch
            Adams and Urbain Le Verrier. Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846[1] by
            Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was
            discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining 13 known moons were located
            telescopically until the 20th century. The planet's distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent size,
            making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes. Neptune was visited by Voyager 2, when it flew
            by the planet on 25 August 1989; Voyager 2 remains the only spacecraft to have visited Neptune.[17][18] The
            advent of the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics has recently
            allowed for additional detailed observations from afar.
